        <h2>Introduction to the Story of Project Zomboid</h2> 
        <p>
            The apocalypse arrived silently but devastatingly. Project Zomboid transports players to a world where the daily lives of thousands of people have been disrupted by a rapidly spreading zombie outbreak, consuming entire cities and plunging humanity into chaos. Set in the state of Kentucky, in the United States, the game does not deliver a linear narrative, but offers fragments of history that invite you to create a scenario of destruction and despair through exploration and survival.
            <br>
            <br>The outbreak began without explanation, taking the population by surprise. Communications were disrupted, and efforts to contain the infestation failed. Reports of panic and resistance were lost when the number of infected people exceeded containment capacity. There are no heroes or magical solutions — just a brutal reality that requires adaptation to survive.
        </p>

            The cities of Knox County—West Point, Riverside, Rosewood, Muldraugh, Louisville, and March Ridge—have been transformed from vibrant centers of life into dangerous places infested by the undead. Each location tells a part of this tragedy. Abandoned houses hold stories of families who tried to resist; empty supermarkets reveal desperation for supplies; found notes and diaries suggest the last words of ordinary people who faced the end of the world.
            <br>
            <br>The game not only presents zombies as the main threat, but also highlights the collapse of society and the fight for survival. Resources such as water, electricity and food become scarce. Nature, previously ignored by civilization, begins to regain its space, while the dead dominate the streets. In this hostile environment, the biggest enemy can be the lack of hope itself or the decisions made in moments of despair.
            <br>
            <br>While there is no traditional story with central characters or a predefined plot, the narrative emerges organically. Your actions and choices define your character's trajectory. Will you prioritize security or take risks in search of resources? Will you isolate yourself or try to form alliances? These decisions are what turn each game session into a unique experience.
            <br>
            <br>Furthermore, subtle elements in the environment help to build an immersive narrative. Through recorded messages, letters found or even details such as house decorations and personal objects, the player realizes the impact of the apocalypse on people's lives. Everything in the setting is purposely left to tell a little more about the world before and after the infestation.
